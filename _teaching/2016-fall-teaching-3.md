AP Computer Science A
======
2016 - present

AP Computer Science A is an introductory college-level computer science course. Students cultivate their understanding of coding through analyzing, writing, and testing code as they explore concepts like modularity, variables, and control structures using the programming language Java.

AP Computer Science Principles
======
2018 - 2020

AP Computer Science Principles is an introductory college-level computing course that introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer science. Students learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs. They incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge. Students also explain how computing innovations and computing systems—including the internet—work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that is collaborative and ethical.

Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms
======

2020 - present

This course teaches students to use and implement commonly used algorithms and data
structures, and code fluently in an object-oriented paradigm using the
programming language Java. This course was historically offered as AP Computer Science AB.
