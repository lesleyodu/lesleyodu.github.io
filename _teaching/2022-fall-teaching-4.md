Through a partnership between Northern Virginia Community College and Fairfax County Public Schools,
dual enrollment courses allow high school students to earn credit toward their high school diploma and college credit at the same time. 
I met the credentialing requirements necessary to be considered faculty by earning my master's degree in education and
18 additional graduate credits in computer science. Discrete Structures and Computer Organization is a year-long course.

CSC 205: Computer Organization
======
2022 - present

Examines the hierarchical structure of computer architecture. Focuses on multi-level machine organization. Uses assembler programming to 
complete simple projects. Includes processors, instruction, execution, addressing techniques, data representation and digital logic. 

CSC 208: Discrete Structures
======
2022 - present

Introduces discrete mathematics concepts in relation to computer science. Applies the use of Boolean algebra, analysis of algorithms such as logic, 
sets and functions, recursive algorithms, and recurrence relations, combinatorics, graphs, and trees.
